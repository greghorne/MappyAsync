# MappyAysnc

Scope:  Display a map with geospatial analytics.

Goal:   Use extensive asynchronous coding wherever possible.

Comment: I don't think making everything asynchronous is necessarily the ideal implementation for this app.  However, I look forward to learning much more about asynchronous applications by working on this project.  There will be a number of pieces to this project mostly in the form of API's. 

Refer to https://github.com/greghorne/MappyAysnc/projects/1 for progress on this project.
